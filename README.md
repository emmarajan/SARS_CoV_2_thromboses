# SARS_CoV_2_thromboses
This repository contains the code used to analyse and visualise data from our study called
**Antiphospholipid antibodies are enriched post-acute COVID-19 but do not modulate the thrombotic risk**. 
As stated within the Rmarkdown code file and the HTML output, in case of a discrepancy, 
the version/interpretation given in the peer reviewed journal article is supposedly correct.
In case of any questions, you are invited to reach out to marc.emmenegger@usb.ch.
We hope that our work is of value to you.
Yours Vishalini and Marc Emmenegger.
